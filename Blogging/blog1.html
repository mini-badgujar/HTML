            <h2>Flower</h2>
            <hr>
            <p id="flower">A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in
                flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae). Flowers produce gametophytes, which in flowering
                plants consist of a few haploid cells which produce gametes. The "male" gametophyte, which produces
                non-motile sperm, is enclosed within pollen grains; the "female" gametophyte is contained within the
                ovule. When pollen from the anther of a flower is deposited on the stigma, this is called pollination.
                Some flowers may self-pollinate, producing seed using pollen from the same flower or a different flower
                of the same plant, but others have mechanisms to prevent self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination,
                when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different
                individual of the same species.</p>
            <p>Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are
                positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. This pollination does not require an
                investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.</p>
            <p>Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are
                the site where gametophytes develop.</p>
            <p>Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and butterflies, to transfer their pollen
                between different flowers, and have evolved to attract these pollinators by various strategies,
                including brightly colored, conspicuous petals, attractive scents, and the production of nectar, a food
                source for pollinators.[2] In this way, many flowering plants have co-evolved with pollinators be
                mutually dependent on services they provide to one another—in the plant's case, a means of reproduction;
                in the pollinator's case, a source of food.[3] After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops
                into fruit containing seeds.</p>
            <p>Flowers have long been appreciated by humans for their beauty and pleasant scents, and also hold cultural
                significance as religious, ritual, or symbolic objects, or sources of medicine and food.</p>


            <h2 id="Morphology">Morphology</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The morphology of a flower, or its form and structure,[6] can be considered in two parts: the vegetative
                part, consisting of non-reproductive structures such as petals; and the reproductive or sexual parts. A
                stereotypical flower is made up of four kinds of structures attached to the tip of a short stalk or
                axis, called a receptacle. Each of these parts or floral organs is arranged in a spiral called a
                whorl.[7] The four main whorls (starting from the base of the flower or lowest node and working upwards)
                are the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium. Together the calyx and corolla make up the
                non-reproductive part of the flower called the perianth, and in some cases may not be differentiated. If
                this is the case, then they are described as tepals.</p>

            <h2 id="Pollination">Pollination</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The primary purpose of the flower is reproduction.Since the flowers are the reproductive organs of the
                plant, they mediate the joining of the sperm, contained within pollen, to the ovules — contained in the
                ovary. Pollination is the movement of pollen from the anthers to the stigma. Normally pollen is moved
                from one plant to another, known as cross-pollination, but many plants are able to self-pollinate.
                Cross-pollination is preferred because it allows for genetic variation, which contributes to the
                survival of the species. Many flowers are dependent, then, upon external factors for pollination, such
                as: the wind, water, animals, and especially insects. Larger animals such as birds, bats, and even some
                pygmy possums, however, can also be employed.To accomplish this, flowers have specific designs which
                encourage the transfer of pollen from one plant to another of the same species. The period of time
                during which this process can take place (when the flower is fully expanded and functional) is called
                anthesis,hence the study of pollination biology is called anthecology.</p>

            <p>Flowering plants usually face evolutionary pressure to optimize the transfer of their pollen, and this is
                typically reflected in the morphology of the flowers and the behaviour of the plants. Pollen may be
                transferred between plants via a number of 'vectors,' or methods. Around 80% of flowering plants make
                use of biotic, or living vectors. Others use abiotic, or non-living, vectors and some plants make use of
                multiple vectors, but most are highly specialised.</p>

            <p>Though some fit between or outside of these groups,most flowers can be divided between the following two
                broad groups of pollination methods:</p>

            <h4>
                <li>Biotic pollination</li>
            </h4>
            <p>Flowers that use biotic vectors attract and use insects, bats, birds, or other animals to transfer pollen
                from one flower to the next. Often they are specialized in shape and have an arrangement of the stamens
                that ensures that pollen grains are transferred to the bodies of the pollinator when it lands in search
                of its attractant (such as nectar, pollen, or a mate). In pursuing this attractant from many flowers of
                the same species, the pollinator transfers pollen to the stigmas—arranged with equally pointed
                precision—of all of the flowers it visits.Many flowers rely on simple proximity between flower parts to
                ensure pollination, while others have elaborate designs to ensure pollination and prevent
                self-pollination.Flowers use animals including: insects (entomophily), birds (ornithophily), bats
                (chiropterophily), lizards, and even snails and slugs (malacophilae).</p>
            <h4>
                <li>Abiotic pollination</li>
            </h4>
            <p>Flowers that use abiotic, or non-living, vectors use the wind or, much less commonly, water, to move
                pollen from one flower to the next.In wind-dispersed (anemophilous) species, the tiny pollen grains are
                carried, sometimes many thousands of kilometres, by the wind to other flowers. Common examples include
                the grasses, birch trees, along with many other species in the order fagales, ragweeds, and many sedges.
                They have no need to attract pollinators and therefore tend not to grow large, showy, or colorful
                flowers, and do not have nectaries, nor a noticeable scent. Because of this, plants typically have many
                thousands of tiny flowers which have comparatively large, feathery stigmas; to increase the chance of
                pollen being received.Whereas the pollen of entomophilous flowers is usually large, sticky, and rich in
                protein (to act as a "reward" for pollinators), anemophilous flower pollen is typically small-grained,
                very light, smooth, and of little nutritional value to insects.In order for the wind to effectively pick
                up and transport the pollen, the flowers typically have anthers loosely attached to the end of long thin
                filaments, or pollen forms around a catkin which moves in the wind. Rarer forms of this involve
                individual flowers being moveable by the wind (Pendulous), or even less commonly; the anthers exploding
                to release the pollen into the wind.

            <p>Pollination through water (hydrophily) is a much rarer method, occurring in only around 2% of abiotically
                pollinated flowers.Common examples of this include Calitriche autumnalis, Vallisneria spiralis and some
                sea-grasses. One characteristic which most species in this group share is a lack of an exine, or
                protective layer, around the pollen grain. Paul Knuth identified two types of hydrophilous pollination
                in 1906 and Ernst Schwarzenbach added a third in 1944. Knuth named his two groups Hyphydrogamy and the
                more common Ephydrogamy. In Hyphydrogamy pollination occurs below the surface of the water and so the
                pollen grains are typically negatively buoyant. For marine plants that exhibit this method the stigmas
                are usually stiff, while freshwater species have small and feathery stigmas. In Ephydrogamy pollination
                occurs on the surface of the water and so the pollen has a low density to enable floating, though many
                also use rafts, and are hydrophobic. Marine flowers have floating thread-like stigmas and may have
                adaptations for the tide, while freshwater species create indentations in the water. The third category,
                set out by Schwarzenbach, is those flowers which transport pollen above the water through conveyance.
                This ranges from floating plants, (Lemnoideae), to staminate flowers (Vallisneria). Most species in this
                group have dry, spherical pollen which sometimes forms into larger masses, and female flowers which form
                depressions in the water; the method of transport varies.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>History shows that flowers have been used by humans for thousands of years, to serve a variety of
                purposes. An early example of this is from about 4,500 years ago in Ancient Egypt, where flowers would
                be used to decorate women's hair. Flowers have also inspired art time and time again, such as in Monet's
                Water Lilies or William Wordsworth's poem about daffodils entitled: "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud".</p>
            <p>Brazilian sailors pay floral tribute to British naval flag officer Thomas Cochrane in Westminster Abbey,
                In modern times, people have sought ways to cultivate, buy, wear, or otherwise be around flowers and
                blooming plants, partly because of their agreeable appearance and smell. Around the world, people use
                flowers to mark important events in their lives</p>
